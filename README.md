# Sandys-portfolio

## Description

This project aims to build an effective portfolio to showcase the developer's work throughout their learning journey. The web application is built from scratch, applying the skills learned such as CSS variables, Flexbox and media queries. 

In this portfolio, you'll find the developer's name, a bit about themselves, their work and contact details. 
The developer will continue to update their portfolio as they progress through their coding bootcamp and apply new skills learnt in their future works.


## Usage

Below is a screenshot of the deployed webpage
